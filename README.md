## Bitcoin Quadric version 0.1.0

A fork of VerusCoin v0.5.7-2 (which is a fork of Komodo, which is a fork of Zcash), and thanks to the hard work by the VerusCoin team in developing VerusHash, Bitcoin Quadric uses a CPU-optimized hash algorithm and a new Proof of Stake algorithm which solves the problem of nothing at stake. With Zcash upstream in the fork family, Quadric brings a unique set of features and benefits to blockchain, including zk-SNARK privacy allowing for anonymous-while-public transactions which are sustainable into quantum computing. 

Quadric introduces a new coin, BTQ, which can be mined using the VerusHash algo from a compatible modern CPU, GPU, or FPGA, with a price-hardware fairness, making it a truly CPU friendly coin while maintaining profitability for GPU and FPGA miners.

## Quadric
This software is the Quadric client and can be used to sync the BTQ blockchain, mine natively, manage a wallet, run a full node, etc. Because Quadric uses zk-SNARK technology, the Sapling Zcash params are required, but they are small and will download reletively quick.

The Quadric wallet syncs with and stores locally, the BTQ blockchain. It downloads and saves the entire history of BTQ transactions, which may take a while depending on your computer speed and network connection.
